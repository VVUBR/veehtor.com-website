  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Why should I pay for an audit when I can just try AI tools myself?",
      "answer": "Most companies waste $50K+ on AI tools that sit unused because they lack a strategic implementation plan. An audit gives you a clear roadmap with ROI projections, so you invest in the right solutions from day one. Think of it as insurance against expensive mistakes."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if the audit reveals no good AI opportunities for my business?",
      "answer": "If we determine AI isn't a fit for your current workflows, we'll tell you upfront and refund 50% of the audit fee. However, in 3+ years of consulting, we've never had a client where we couldn't identify at least one high-ROI opportunity."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to have a technical team to implement your recommendations?",
      "answer": "No. We handle all implementation if you choose the Full Implementation package. For Audit/Roadmap clients, we provide detailed documentation and vendor recommendations that any technical partner can execute. We can also refer implementation partners if needed."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you measure ROI on AI projects?",
      "answer": "We establish baseline metrics during the audit (e.g., time spent on manual tasks, cost per customer interaction) and track improvements post-implementation. Most clients see measurable ROI within 60-90 days through reduced labor costs, faster response times, or increased conversion rates."

No vendor lock-in. Just results you can measure in 90 days.",
